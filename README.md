# “Retired Places”: Ageing, Housing Vacancy and Dispersed Settlements in Italy

**“Retired Places”** is a data-driven dashboard that explores how demographic ageing, housing vacancy and settlement structure interact across Italian regions.  

The project combines official statistics from **ISTAT** with volunteered geographic information from **OpenStreetMap** to compare where “retired people” and “retired places” overlap – and where they do not.

The application was developed as a final project for the course  
**Open Access and Digital Ethics (a.y. 2024/2025)** within the  
**Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge (DHDK) Master’s Degree** at the  
**Alma Mater Studiorum – University of Bologna**.
